# Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization

#### Phonepe became a leading digital payments company

- The Indian digital payments story has truly captured the world's imagination.
- From the largest towns to the remotest villages, there is a payments revolution being driven by the penetration of mobile phones, mobile internet and states-of-the-art payments infrastructure built as Public Goods championed by the central bank and the government.
- Founded in December 2015, PhonePe has been a strong beneficiary of the API driven digitisation of payments in India. When we started, we were constantly looking for granular and definitive data sources on digital payments in India. 
- PhonePe Pulse is our way of giving back to the digital payments ecosystem.
